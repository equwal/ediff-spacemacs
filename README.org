* Description
Provide bindings for Ediff, the Emacs diff-er.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =ediff-bindings= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in
this file.

* Key bindings
  The prefix is ~SPC e d~ for the mnemonic SPACE-E-DIFF (spaceydiff?). They are
  meant to be listed in More Important First Order (MIFO). The long names are used where possible (since some have two names).
